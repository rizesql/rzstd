Modern lossless compression formats, such as Zstandard, rely on a combination of Finite State
Entropy for symbol coding and auto-regressive back-reference mechanisms for signal reconstruction.
This paper presents \textit{rzstd}, a memory-safe Rust implementation of the Zstandard
decompression algorithm that explicitly models decoding as a bounded, finite-state process.
The architecture enforces protocol invariants through constructive parsing, proactively validates
mathematical constraints over discrete probability distributions, and utilizes an ahead-of-time
memory allocation strategy to strictly bound the LZ77 sliding window routine. Empirical measurements
using the Silesia Compression Corpus indicate that the implementation achieves a practical decompression
throughput of approximately \qty{640}{\mebi\byte\per\s} on an ARM64 architecture. These
results demonstrate that strict type-level invariant enforcement and safe memory semantics
can be integrated into a signal processing pipeline while preserving baseline algorithmic
scaling.
